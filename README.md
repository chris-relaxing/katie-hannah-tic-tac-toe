# Katie & Hannah Tic Tac Toe

Tic-tac-toe game themed for Katie and Hannah!

Written with:
* React.js
* JavaScript (ES6)
* JSX
* CSS
* HTML

To Do: Ideas to implement:
* Add choice of whether or not to use photos instead of Xs and Os
* The winner gets a pop-up photo as a prize for winning. Figure out how to use a modal for this. (Horses for Katie, bunnies for Hannah) These can be selected at random from a list of photos.
* For Cat's Game, display a random cute kitten. (using modal)
* Make the script load the images from a file instead of using a hard coded list.

This game can be played on my website here:<BR>
